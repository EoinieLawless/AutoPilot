# AutoPilot
A repository for my 4th year module - "Artificial Intelligence"

In this project, the goal was to implement code to achieve a nueral network model, which allows the pilot in the game to actively avoid obstacles. This is done by sampling arrays of the map, using these arrays with an aligned movement output, allowing the model to predict how to avoid.

The files it produces are “game_data.txt” and 
“plane_control.data”.
